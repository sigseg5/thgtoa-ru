Donations to support this project are welcome (I'm definitely not a tech billionaire/millionaire and my budget is actually quite limited). 
Those donations are used to pay for Tor onion hosting (VPS), Mail hosting, and the Domain name (anonymousplanet.org). No profit is being made.
All donations and expenses are being logged here below for transparency.
